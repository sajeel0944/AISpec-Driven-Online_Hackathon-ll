# Hackathon-02 Project

## Overview
This project was built in multiple phases, starting from a simple Python console application and evolving into a full-stack, containerized solution with an AI-powered RAG chatbot.

### Phase 1 — Todo In-Memory Python Console App
- Built a CLI-based Todo application in Python
- Data stored in memory (no database)
- Features:
  - Add todo
  - View todos
  - Update todo
  - Delete todo
- Focused on core logic and CRUD flow

### Phase 2 — Full Frontend + Backend with APIs
- Converted console app into full-stack application
- Developed backend APIs
- Connected frontend with backend using API integration
- Implemented full CRUD operations through APIs
- Structured project with proper models and routes

**Backend:**
- Python API framework
- Database integration
- REST endpoints

**Frontend:**
- UI for managing todos
- API-based data handling

### Phase 3 — RAG Chatbot Integration
- Added Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot
- Chatbot can answer based on project data/context
- Integrated embeddings + retrieval pipeline
- Enabled smart query-based responses

### Phase 4 — Docker Containerization
- Dockerized the full application
- Created Dockerfile and container setup
- Ensured consistent environment setup
- App runs via container without local dependency issues

## Tech Stack
- Python
- API Framework
- Database
- Frontend UI
- RAG / AI Integration
- Docker

## Result
A phased evolution from a simple CLI todo app to a full-stack, AI-enabled, containerized application.
